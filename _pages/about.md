Hack The College App is a definitve guide to all things applying to college. This guide will cover the entire college application process, from course selections in high school, to test-taking strategies, writing essays, extra-curriculars, and more. This guide is geared specifically for high school students in the United States in 9th grade and above. Younger students within the US can certainly take advantage of all this guide has to offer by using it as a high school planning tool. This guide (in parts or as a whole) may be applicable for students outside the US, but no guarantees can be made.

Finally, this guide is only that, a guide. It does not require a strict adherence, following suggestions down to the letter. Rather, it is best to use this guide to gain a more complete understanding of how the college application process works and how to have a better chance of getting into a desired college.
