## Studying for the exams

The content of both exams are quite similar; however, there are some technical differnces between the exams, such as number of questions per section and amount of time per section. The ACT is unique in having a Science Reasoning section, although this section mainly tests reading graphs and tables and drawing conclusions based upon reasearch, much like questions on the SAT Math section. Let's now take a look at the types of questions you'll see in each section of the exams. *We will work through some practice questions in a later post, I will attach the link to that post once it is complete.*

## SAT: Reading Test Question Types

> The Reading Test focuses on the skills and knowledge at the heart of education: the stuff you’ve been learning in high school, the stuff you’ll need to succeed in college. It’s about how you take in, think about, and use information. And guess what? You’ve been doing that for years. <cite>[SAT Reading Test Website](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/inside-the-test/reading)</cite>{: .small}

There are three sorts of questions you will see on the SAT Reading Test:

* Command of Evidence
    * These questions will ask you to find the best quote to support a claim
    * They can also ask you how the author supports his/her own claims
    * Finally, they can ask you how a chart/graph relates to the passage it's paired with
* Words in Context
    * These questions essentially ask you for the meaning of a word or a phrase
    * Unlike the pre-March 2016 changes to SAT (which had asked you to define obscure words), these are common words and phrases
    * You need to define words/phrases *as they are used in the passage*. You may also need to describe how word choice affects the tone and mood of the passage
* Analysis in History/
