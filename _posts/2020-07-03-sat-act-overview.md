*This article will only cover the SAT (SAT I) and the ACT. SAT Subject Tests (SAT IIs) will be discussed in a future article. Additionally, this article only provides a brief overview on the structure of the SAT and the ACT. In-depth analysis of question types and problem solving strategies will be discussed in future articles.*

Standardized testing requirements form a major part of your college application. College admissions officers want to see what you know, how well you recall it, and how you can apply it to solve problems in a timed—and admittedly stressful—environment. Of all components of your application package aside from coursework and extracurriculars, you will spend the most time preparing for and taking the SAT and/or ACT.

## What is the SAT?

The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test developed and administered by the CollegeBoard, an American not-for-profit organization. There are five sections to the SAT: reading, writing/grammar, math without calculator, math with calculator, and an **optional** essay section. See the comparision table below for more details.

## What is the ACT?

The ACT (American College Test) is a standardized test developed and adminitered by the ACT Inc., an American non-profit organization. There are five sections to the ACT: English, math, reading, scientific reasoning, and an **optional** essay section. Again, see the comparision table below for more details.

## Which test should I take?

While there are key differences between the SAT and ACT, they are also similar in some regards. The most important difference is that while they take roughly the same amount of time (SAT: 180 minutes, 230 with essay; ACT: 175 minutes, 215 with essay), the ACT has far more questions (SAT: 154; ACT: 215). The SAT offers a generous 70 seconds per question, while the ACT only gives you 49 seconds per question. The ACT is arguably faster-paced, but some test-takers claim the exam is easier, despite the added time pressure.

Choosing which test to take and when to take them is a personal choice. Most students take the test in the spring of their junior year. If they are unsatisfied with their score, they usually retake the test in the summer after junior year. The early fall of the senior year is the latest you can take the test.

I took the SAT twice. I did not take the ACT. My first test (October 2018) resulted in a 1480. I felt that I could've done better, so I studied harder and took about a dozen practice tests (under full test-day conditions) and retook the SAT in December 2018, scoring a 1550. I was satisfied with this score and decided against retaking it.

Because of my experience with the SAT, I recommend taking the SAT first. Also, because the CollegeBoard also administers the SAT Subject Tests and the AP Exams, you only need to create one account. If you do decide to take the ACT, that is an additional online account to maintainl sticking to the SAT streamlines the process. Regardless of which exam you take, the study tips are the same.

> Practice makes perfect.

All of the material tested on the SAT/ACT are things you've already learned in high school. The key is to practice, and practice *a lot*. Sure, maybe you can solve the quadratic equation for any trinomial in one dimension, but can you do it under time pressure? Can you do it early in the morning? Can you do it while your hand is cramping and you need to use the bathroom?

> Knowing the material on the test is only half the struggle.

Again, it's no good memorizing a bunch of facts and equations. You need to be able to apply them to word problems. You may know how to find a side length of a right triangle given the other two side lengths (hint: use the Pythagorean Theorem) but it may not strike you to use it if the question doesn't explicitly ask for it. If Sally has a 20 foot ladder leaning against the side of her house and positioned 12 feet away from the side of her house, what is the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground where it meets the house? Nowhere does this question ask you to use the Pythagorean Theorem, but that is exactly what you need to use (you should find that the distance between the top of the ladder and the ground is 16 feet).

<hr>

Regardless of whether you choose to take the SAT or the ACT, the standardized test makes up a significant portion of your application package. You need to take it seriously. Starting to prepare early on is key. As I noted above, most students take the test in the spring of their junior year and possibly again in the summer after junior year. Finally, you need to plan for preparing and taking the SAT/ACT in context with the rest of your application, including extracurriculars, essays, and school coursework.
